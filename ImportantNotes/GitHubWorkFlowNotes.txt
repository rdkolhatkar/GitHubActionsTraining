A GitHub Workflow is an automated process defined in a repository using YAML files inside the .github/workflows/ folder.
It is part of GitHub Actions and helps automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying code.
A workflow is triggered by events (e.g., push, pull_request, or schedule) and consists of one or more jobs, which are groups of steps.
Steps can run shell commands or use reusable actions. Jobs run on runners (machines provided by GitHub or self-hosted).
